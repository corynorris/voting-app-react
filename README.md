# Voting App React
## Overview
The following app demonstrates a `NodeJS` server that uses `Socket IO` to demonstrate a real-time voting application.  The front end of the application uses `ReactJS` and `Redux` as a data store. This was done thanks to the following [tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html).

## Contents
